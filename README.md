# motion_identification

Project inspired by Brenner Heintz's "Training a Neural Network to Detect Gestures with OpenCV in Python" article and model [1] and Chad Hart's "Computer Vision on the Web with WebRTC and TensorFlow" article and model [2]. 

## Application runs in Ubuntu 20.0.4 using PostgreSQL 12.6.

## To initiate gesture recognition application,
### 1) clone repository
### 2) Install packages from requirements.txt
### 3) Execute "python manage.py createdb", "python manage.py create_image_dir", "python manage.py runserver"

## To retrain model,
### 1) Navigate to /motion_identification/ subdirectory
### 2) Execute "python
